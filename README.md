# Track-My-Impact: Waste Classification and Environmental Footprint Calculator
 A Streamlit-powered application that classifies household waste images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and calculates the associated environmental impact (CO2, water, and energy savings) of proper waste disposal. This project aims to raise awareness and encourage sustainable waste management practices.
